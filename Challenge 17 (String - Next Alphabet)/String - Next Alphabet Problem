String - Next Alphabet

The program must accept N integers and a string S as the input. For each integer X among the N integers, the program must replace the first X alphabets in the string S with their next alphabet in the English alphabet set. Finally, the program must print the modified string S as the output.
Note: The English alphabet set is considered in a cyclic fashion for the next alphabet of a given alphabet.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Each integer value <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
2 1 3 5
abcde

Output:
eeeef

Explanation:
Here S = abcde.
The 1st integer is 2, so the first 2 alphabets in the string abcde are replaced with their next alphabet b and c. Now the string becomes bccde.
The 2nd integer is 1, so the first alphabet in the string bccde is replaced with its next alphabet c. Now the string becomes cccde.
The 3rd integer is 3, so the first 3 alphabets in the string cccde are replaced with their next alphabet d, d and d. Now the string becomes dddde.
The 4th integer is 5, so the first 5 alphabets in the string dddde are replaced with their next alphabets e, e, e, e and f. Now the string becomes eeeef.
So eeeef is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
2 1 3
ZEBRA

Output:
CGCRA
