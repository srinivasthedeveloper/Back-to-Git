# Back-to-Git
First repo in Git...
# Code Used in This Program:-

print("Hello Git\nFinally I am Back to Love You.....\n ...\n'0+0'\n`{ }`\n * *")

# Output:-

Hello Git
Finally I am Back to Love You.....
# | ...  
# |'0^0' 
# |`{ }` 
# | * *  
 
# COMMANDS USED:-
print()  ---> its a predefined method which is available in python.
              This is used to print/show the output to the user, it will prints whatever we put inside the ("Your message") like this.
              
'\n'    ---> its an escape secquence it will not show the same it looks. Instead of it will create a blank new line/break current line.
             thats why we got the output like that.
             
Need more clarification Let me know...
Happy Learning {*_*}
