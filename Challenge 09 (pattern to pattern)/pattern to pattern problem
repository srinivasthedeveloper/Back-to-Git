Pattern to Pattern

The program must accept a list of patterns separated by a colon (:) as the input. Each pattern contains a list of integers separated by a hyphen (-). The program must print the output based on the following conditions.
- If a-b is a pattern, then the program must print the integers from a to b in a line.
- If a-b-c is a pattern, then the program must print the integers from a to b in a line and then the program must print the integers from b to c in the next line. Similarly, the integers are printed based on the number of integers in the pattern.
Note: The integers in each pattern are always sorted in ascending order.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Total number of patterns <= 20
2 <= Total number of integers in each pattern <= 10
1 <= Each integer value <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains a list of patterns separated by a colon, where each pattern contains a list of integers separated by a hyphen.

Output Format:
The lines containing the integers separated by a space based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
2-5-9-11:3-9

Output:
2 3 4 5
5 6 7 8 9
9 10 11
3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Explanation:
There are two patterns separated by a colon.
The first pattern is 2-5-9-11.
The integers from 2 to 5 are printed in the first line.
The integers from 5 to 9 are printed in the second line.
The integers from 9 to 11 are printed in the third line.
The second pattern is 3-9.
The integers from 3 to 9 are printed in the fourth line.
Hence the output is
2 3 4 5
5 6 7 8 9
9 10 11
3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5-7:4-9:3-4-8-13

Output:
5 6 7
4 5 6 7 8 9
3 4
4 5 6 7 8
8 9 10 11 12 13
