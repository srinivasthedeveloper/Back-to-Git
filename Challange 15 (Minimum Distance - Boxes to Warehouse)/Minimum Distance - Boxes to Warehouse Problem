Minimum Distance - Boxes to Warehouse

There are N boxes need to be stored in a warehouse. The distance between each box and the warehouse is passed as the input to the program. A boy can collect a maximum of two boxes at a time. The program must print the minimum distance the boy travel to store all N boxes in the warehouse as the output.
Note: The boy always starts from the warehouse to store the boxes.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Distance between each box and the warehouse <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the minimum distance the boy travel to store all N boxes in the warehouse.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
7 3 8 5 11

Output:
42

Explanation:
The minimum distance the boy travel to store all N boxes in the warehouse is 42.
One of the possible ways is given below.
22(11 and 8) + 14(7 and 5) + 6(3) = 42.
So 42 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10
18 32 30 17 24 33 37 20 19 16

Output:
258
