Largest Integer - Sorted Digits

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print the largest integer which is less than or equal to N, where the digits are sorted in ascending order as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
100 <= N <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the largest integer with sorted digits.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
322

Output:
299

Explanation:
Here N = 322.
The largest integer is 299, which is less than or equal to 322 and also the digits in 299 are sorted in increasing order.
So 299 is printed as the output.
