Matching Word - Replace ?

The program must accept two string values P and S as input. The string P represents a pattern. The string S represents a set of words. The character '?' in P matches any single character. The program must print the word in S that matches the given pattern P as the output. If two or more words match the pattern P, then the program must print the first occurring word as the output.
Note: At least one word in S is always matched with P.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of P <= 100
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains P.
The second line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains a string representing the word in S that matches the pattern P.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
?i?n
LION crane lion breath kiln

Output:

Explanation:
Here P = "?i?n" and S = "LION crane lion breath kiln".
There are two words in S that match the pattern P.
lion klin
So the first occurring word lion is printed as the output.
