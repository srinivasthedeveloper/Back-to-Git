Digit with Maximum Frequency

The program must accept N digits as the input. The program must print the digit with the maximum frequency among the N digits as the output. If two or more digits have the same maximum frequency, the program must print the first repeating digit among those digits as the output.
Note: At least one digit is always repeated among the N digits.

Boundary Condition(s)
2 <= N <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N digits separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains a digit as per the given condition(s).

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
9
1 2 3 4 4 4 5 1 4

Output:
4

Explanation:
The frequency of digit 1 is 2.
The frequency of digit 2 is 1.
The frequency of digit 3 is 1.
The frequency of digit 4 is 4.
The frequency of digit 5 is 1.
The digit 4 has the maximum frequency, so 4 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
10
1 2 1 2 5 2 1 6 5 6

Output:
1

Explanation:
The frequency of digit 1 is 3.
The frequency of digit 2 is 3.
The frequency of digit 5 is 2.
The frequency of digit 6 is 2.
The digits 1 and 2 have the same maximum frequency.
The first repeating digit is 1. So 1 is printed as the output.
